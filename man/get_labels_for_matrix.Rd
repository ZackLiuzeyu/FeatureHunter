\title{Match labels for a matrix by sample IDs}
\usage{
get_labels_for_matrix(X, labels_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{ID
A matrix with row names representing sample IDs.}

\item{labels_list}{A list of label data.frames or matrices. Each element should have at least two columns:
column 1: sample IDs (V1)
column 2: labels (V2)}
}
\value{
0/1
A binary (0/1) label vector, aligned to the row order of \code{X}.
}
\description{
Given a matrix with sample IDs as row names, this function finds the best-matching
label table in \code{labels_list} (by maximizing ID overlap), extracts the label column,
aligns it with the matrix rows, and returns it as a binary vector. Errors if alignment fails.
}
\details{
\code{labels_list}

\code{as_binary01()} 0/1
The function identifies the label table with the highest overlap of sample IDs, then checks for full alignment. Labels are converted to 0/1 using \code{as_binary01()}.
}
\examples{
X <- matrix(rnorm(9), 3, 3)
rownames(X) <- c("s1","s2","s3")
labels_list <- list(data.frame(V1=c("s1","s2","s3"), V2=c("case","control","case")))
get_labels_for_matrix(X, labels_list)
