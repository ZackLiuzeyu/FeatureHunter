\title{Compute F1 score for binary or multiclass}
\usage{
f1_score(predicted, expected, positive.class = "positive")
}
\arguments{
\item{predicted}{Predicted labels (character/factor/numeric; coerced to character then factored).}

\item{expected}{Ground-truth labels (character/factor/numeric; coerced to character then factored).}

\item{positive.class}{\code{"Disease"} \code{"positive"} \code{"1"}
Character name of the positive class for binary tasks (default \code{"positive"}).
If absent from the label set, falls back to \code{"1"}, else to the last level.}
}
\value{
F1
F1
A numeric scalar: the F1 for the positive class (binary) or macro-averaged F1 (multiclass).
}
\description{
F1 Handles both binary and multiclass settings: returns the F1 for the
designated positive class in binary tasks, and the macro-averaged F1 in
multiclass tasks.
}
\details{
/PrecisionRecall
The function explicitly controls factor levels, puts the positive class last,
guards against division-by-zero with \code{pmax}, and macro-averages across classes for multiclass tasks.
}
\examples{
# "positive"
pred <- c("positive","negative","positive","negative","positive")
true <- c("positive","negative","negative","negative","positive")
f1_score(pred, true)
# "1"
pred <- c(1,0,1,0,1); true <- c(1,0,0,0,1)
f1_score(pred, true, positive.class = "positive")
# F1
pred <- c("cat","dog","cat","bird","dog")
true <- c("cat","dog","bird","bird","dog")
f1_score(pred, true)
