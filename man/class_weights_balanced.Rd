\title{/ Compute balanced class weights for binary classification}
\usage{
class_weights_balanced(y)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{0 1
A vector of binary class labels, with values 0 and 1 (numeric or coercible).}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\code{0}: 0 / weight for class 0
\code{1}: 1 / weight for class 1
}
\description{
Computes class weights for binary classification such that each class (0/1)
contributes approximately equally to the overall loss, regardless of class imbalance.
}
\details{
\deqn{w_c = N / (2 \times n_c)}
\eqn{N} \eqn{n_c} \eqn{c}
Thus, rarer classes receive higher weights, balancing the contribution
of positives and negatives in training.
}
\examples{
y <- c(0,0,0,1,1)
class_weights_balanced(y)
# $`0` = 5 / (2*3) = 0.8333
# $`1` = 5 / (2*2) = 1.25
}
